## Project info

**Description**: Hi there! I’m managing a village playground renovation project, and I need help organizing the finances and funding. I’m looking for an app that I can use by myself to track the budget, manage expenses, and keep an eye on fundraising progress.

The app should have a central dashboard that shows the overall budget, funds raised, and remaining balance. I’d like a feature to log and categorize expenses easily, with a comparison between the budgeted and actual spending. It would also be helpful if I could upload and store receipts for reference.

For fundraising, I need to log all incoming funds, keep a record of donors, and set financial goals to track my progress. Simple reporting is essential, so I’d like to generate financial summaries and export them to PDF or CSV.

Lastly, I’d love a task management feature where I can list out tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. Basic notifications, like alerts for overspending or reminders for upcoming tasks, would be a great addition.

Can you help me create an app with these features?
